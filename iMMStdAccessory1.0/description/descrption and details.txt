It provides an easy to use interface with Index view in the main listing page to access remedies starting with a particular letter, an excellent search facility to make a word search in the entire materia medica and a special feature for making notes in the application itself. In the search view an end user can read the remedy details with the search word highlighted in red color. We have included around 700 remedies for the benefit of homeopathic doctors, students and everyone interested in Homoeopathy.
